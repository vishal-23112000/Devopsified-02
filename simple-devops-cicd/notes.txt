NOTES:
- Replace IMAGE_NAME_REPLACE_ME in k8s/deployment.yaml with your image (or use `sed` in CI).
- In GitHub Actions, set the repository secrets:
  DOCKER_USERNAME, DOCKER_PASSWORD, IMAGE_NAME (e.g. youruser/simple-devops-cicd), KUBE_CONFIG (base64 kubeconfig)
- This workflow triggers on pushes to the main branch.
